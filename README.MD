# LLD 

## This project contains:
  - the core concepts of OCP
  - Refactoring code from basic / unstructured -> structured(following some patters) abiding SOLID
  - Every use-case will start from base(branch) and will solve problem one step at a time creating revisions
  - Final version of the use-case will have a tag associated with it.


| Pattern  |   Final Tag    |                    Versions / Branches                    |
|:---------|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Strategy** | `strategy.v1`  | ```[basic-payment, payment-validity, payment-request ]``` |
